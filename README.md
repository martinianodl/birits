### Summary

  > With the steady growth of the Internet many search websites have emerged, however most of these websites only allow you to perform the search using a textual interface. A more intuitive method for the user would be to use melody snippets of a song to perform this search. In this paper, we present a two-stage query-by-playing (QBP) system using symbolic representations where from a melody snippet of a song it is performed the retrieval of a set of similar songs. On the first stage we perform the alignments and calculate its result rank, which may have draws. Stage two was created to help solving this problem, where a classifier-based filter is applied on the results, reducing the number of draws. A new methodology for evaluating QBP is presented, aiming to understand the impact of the number of notes in the query and some alternatives to verify the robustness of the methods considering wrong and missing notes. In addition, a new method based on machine learning (ML) is presented to filter the results. In the experiments this method always improves the performance of queries regardless of the noise.
